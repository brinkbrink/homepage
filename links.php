            <p>I like to think (and<br>
            the sooner the better!)<br>
            of a cybernetic meadow<br>
            where mammals and computers<br>
            live together in mutually<br>
            programming harmony<br>
            like pure water<br>
            touching clear sky.</p>
            
            <p>I like to think<br>
            (right now, please!)<br>
            of a cybernetic forest<br>
            filled with pines and electronics<br>
            where deer stroll peacefully<br>
            past computers<br>
            as if they were flowers<br>
            with spinning blossoms.</p>
        
            <p>I like to think<br>
            (it has to be!)<br>
            of a cybernetic ecology<br>
            where we are free of our labors<br>
            and joined back to nature,<br>
            returned to our mammal<br>
            brothers and sisters,<br>
            and all watched over<br>
            by machines of loving grace.</p>
