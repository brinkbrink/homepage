            <h3>What and Why: Social Media Optimization (SMO)</h3>

            <p>For some time in the world of web design three words that began with an “S” and ended with “Optimization” would clearly bring about only one phrase or acronym--Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Since the advent of social media giants like Facebook and Twitter, however, a new acronym has come to town; SMO, standing for Social Media Optimization. Rohit Bhargava, vice president of interactive marketing with Ogilvy Public Relations, defines the goal of SMO as to "implement changes to optimize a site so that it is more easily linked to, more highly visible in social media searches on custom search engines (such as Technorati), and more frequently included in relevant posts on blogs, podcasts, and vlogs (Fichter).” Over the past decade and a half SMO’s importance has been realized to the level that it rivals SEO (“Twitter”). Of course, there is no need for rivalry, both can and should be utilized to attract more users to websites.
            </p>
            <p>These optimization methods can even be used in tandem. For instance, someone could employ the same keywords that help their SEO in social media content to bring more visitors to both your website and that content. When some of those visitors end up viewing the social media, they are more likely to follow the social media, and then more inclined to procure the products or services (“Twitter”). </p>
            <p>Although sometimes SMO can trump the need for SEO. This is an increasingly common scenario now that Internet users are progressively finding more of their information via social media networks than search engines. A user may find content through social media without ever having to type a keyword into a search engine (Kenton).</p>
            <p>While quantity of traffic can be addressed via other methods like advertisements and social media optimization (SMO), both quality of traffic and organic traffic are chief concerns of SEO. Taking these factors into account it is not surprising that Google recommends that we “gear any optimization toward making the user experience better.” Don’t forget, those users include the search engine itself. So, another way of looking at SEO is seeing it as a methodology that helps search engines “understand and present content (“SEO”).”</p>
            <p>Five principles of SMO, as outlined by head of collections development Doralynn Rossman and lead on digital initiatives Scott W. H. Young at Montana State University, to apply to promotional social media: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create shareable content. </li>
                <li>Make sharing easy. </li>
                <li>Reward engagement. </li>
                <li>Follow an intentional and well-planned approach to sharing. </li>
                <li>Measure use, encourage reuse.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These methods are also easily applied to websites beyond business (Fichter). Libraries, clubs, non-profit organizations, political campaigns and schools also have much to gain from optimizing their web presence via SMO. As long as a person wants to attract more visitors to their website, regardless of reason, they should invest in Social Media Optimization. </p>
