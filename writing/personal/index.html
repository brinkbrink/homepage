<p>Beware of leaders, heroes, organizers.</p>
<p>Watch that stuff. Beware of structure freaks.</p>
<p>They do not understand.</p>
<p>We know the system doesn't work because we're living in its ruins. We know that leaders don't work out because they have all led us only to the present, the good leaders equally with the bad....What the system calls organization--linear organization--is a systematic cage, arbitrarily limiting the possible. It's never worked before. It's always produced the present.</p>

Why we need phone booths--from the impoverished to the victims of Birds attacks...there's a commonality here: the people who need them are not in power.

Mindfulness is just about being in the moment, enjoying the present. I found out that the best way to be was in the moment; that I was truly happy by just being--but really just being--after eating a fistfull of mushrooms amidst the pines down the road from my parent's house (I was 19). It's a shame that they have to teach people this in order to get through all the moments they want to escape. Indulge in the fact that you're alive...pretend that we aren't doing everything to promote the opposite.
