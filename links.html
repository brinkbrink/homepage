            <p>I like to think (and
            the sooner the better!)
            of a cybernetic meadow
            where mammals and computers
            live together in mutually
            programming harmony
            like pure water
            touching clear sky.</p>
            
            <p>I like to think
            (right now, please!)
            of a cybernetic forest
            filled with pines and electronics
            where deer stroll peacefully
            past computers
            as if they were flowers
            with spinning blossoms.</p>
        
            <p>I like to think
            (it has to be!)
            of a cybernetic ecology
            where we are free of our labors
            and joined back to nature,
            returned to our mammal
            brothers and sisters,
            and all watched over
            by machines of loving grace.</p>
