            <p>I like to think (and<br>

            of a cybernetic meadow<br>

            (right now, please!)<br>
            of a cybernetic forest<br>
            filled with pines and electronics<br>
            where deer stroll peacefully<br>
            past computers<br>

            (it has to be!)<br>
            of a cybernetic ecology<br>
            where we are free of our labors<br>

            returned to our mammal<br>
