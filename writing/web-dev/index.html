            <h3><a id="access"></a>The Necessity of Website Accessibility</h3>

            <p>With our society becoming more reliant on the web, website accessibility has grown into a necessity that benefits all. Website accessibility is especially paramount during the current COVID-19 pandemic which has brought more people than ever to the web for a range of needs; from online schooling to online shopping to socializing with loved ones. Website accessibility can be defined as a concept wherein websites are designed, developed and modified so that everybody, regardless of ability, can access and interact with them. Unfortunately, there are reportedly “millions of websites which do not follow accessibility guidelines (Crespo).” Presently, the responsibility of accessible web design is mostly in the hands of web developers. Although some avoid it out of the idea that these guidelines require more effort or knowledge than they can muster, the benefits of accessible web design far outweigh the perceived inconveniences of creating it.</p>
            <p>The statistics around this issue are disheartening. As of 2019 studies analyzing websites for accessible web design found that 70 percent of websites surveyed contained “accessibility blocks” and only one percent of the top million homepages on the web meet accessibility standards, wrote Arielle Pardes for WIRED.  This is all despite the fact that around 7 million people have a visual disability in the United States, and more than that have a myriad of other disabilities that affect their access to the web. A lot of the issues encountered aren’t even difficult to remedy--like screen readers being faced with vague labels for elements like “image1.png” or “link (Pardes).” While some web design accessibility is more nuanced, involves more knowledge, or can be more complex, simple accessibility problems like these somehow persist. Instead, many people with disabilities, and people outside of that group as... <a href="/writing/web-dev/accessibility.html">Read more!</a></p>

            <h3><a id="seo"></a>The Basics of Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>

            <p>It appears to be in the name already but you may be wondering--what exactly is “Search Engine Optimization?” The most basic definition is that it is a methodology to improve your site’s visibility in search engine results. The value in SEO is its ability to attract more visitors to your website (“What is SEO / Search Engine Optimization?”). Today search engines are the most prominent way that people find websites, whether they represent businesses or artists or something in between, and are therefore invaluable to those owning or maintaining websites.  </p>
            <p>To better understand SEO, it's important to better understand how search engines operate. Search engines (think Google, Bing, Duckduckgo, etc) create massive indexes of websites using bots, called crawlers, that collect information from sites and use that information to include them in the aforementioned index. Algorithms then analyze the pages within the index, utilizing hundreds of factors, to figure out the ranking of pages in search results for a given query. The factors in question are typically determined based on estimates of how well a website or page can give the search engine user what they want to find (“What is SEO / Search Engine Optimization?”). These factors can be manipulated and this is where SEO can step in to... <a href="/writing/web-dev/seo.html">Read more!</a></p>

            <h3><a id="restaurant"></a>Restaurant Industry Research</h3>

            <p>In this summary I would like to explore methods that will be used on your restaurant website based on my research.</p>
            <p>First, the basics. While it may seem to be an obvious inclusion, it is an absolute necessity to have accurate information about your restaurant on its website. This information encompasses hours of operation, location, phone number, menu, prices, and email or contact form. Accurate information has become especially important with the rise of microsites (blurbs on Google, Yelp, etc) and their conflicting claims about these specifics (Behera).</p>
            <p>Another basic to cover is incorporating either a call-to-action or reservation widget. This should be one of the first things a customer notices when visiting the website. It allows potential customers an easy transition into becoming current customers (Peeling).</p>
            <p>The design of the website should be clean and inviting, just like your restaurant. This means simplicity; simple layout, clear navigation, and accessibility. It is also a good idea to match the feel of the website to the feel of its accompanying restaurant, something that represents what the customer will experience once they step into the physical space (Behera). One way to ensure this matching of virtual and physical experiences besides using similar color schemes and styles is to include a photo gallery of your food and the restaurant itself. This not only matches... <a href="/writing/web-dev/restaurant.html">Read more!</a></p>

            <h3><a id="che"></a>Che Case Study</h3>

            <p>Cafe Che Che is a local, woman-owned coffee bean roastery with a website poised to show off their products, give more information about the business and its owner, host a store for national orders as well as provide a Google form for local orders. The owner of the business and its accompanying website came to me for a website refresh. It “worked,” but it still had unfulfilled potential.
                So I navigated my browser to their website and viewed it with Chrome’s Developer Tools

            <h3><a id="smo"></a>What and Why: Social Media Optimization (SMO)</h3>

            <p>For some time in the world of web design three words that began with an “S” and ended with “Optimization” would clearly bring about only one phrase or acronym--Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Since the advent of social media giants like Facebook and Twitter, however, a new acronym has come to town; SMO, standing for Social Media Optimization. Rohit Bhargava, vice president of interactive marketing with Ogilvy Public Relations, defines the goal of SMO as to "implement changes to optimize a site so that it is more easily linked to, more highly visible in social media searches on custom search engines (such as Technorati), and more frequently included in relevant posts on blogs, podcasts, and vlogs (Fichter).” Over the past decade and a half SMO’s importance has been realized to the level that it rivals SEO (“Twitter”). Of course, there is no need for rivalry, both can and should be utilized to attract more users to websites.
            </p>
            <p>These optimization methods can even be used in tandem. For instance, someone could employ the same keywords that help their SEO in social media content to bring more visitors to both your website and that content. When some of those visitors end up viewing the social media, they are more likely to follow the social media, and then more inclined to procure the products or...<a href="/writing/web-dev/smo.html">Read more!</a></p>

            <h3><a id="analytics"></a>Data Analytics Basics Presentation</h3>

            <p>Data analytics is a field that is concerned with the process of collecting, organizing and analyzing data in order to draw helpful conclusions from it. The main purpose of data analytics is to find meaning in data so that the derived knowledge can be used to make informed decisions.... <a href="/writing/web-dev/dummy-analytics.html">Read more!</a></p>

            <h3><a id="forms"></a>Improving on HTML Forms</h3>

            <p>When engaging visitors on a website, a lot of engagement is one way--the website conveying information to the visitor--but sometimes a two way engagement is necessary. Sometimes visitors need to contact persons affiliated with the website and sometimes persons affiliated with the website want or need to collect information from the visitors. These contacts and collections can take the shape of contact forms, job applications, idea submission forms, guest books and much more (Garofalo).</p>
            <p>The most popular way to facilitate this kind of communication is through HTML Forms. According to w3.org, “an HTML form is a section of a document containing normal content, markup, special elements called controls (checkboxes, radio buttons, menus, etc.), and labels on those controls. Users generally "complete" a form by modifying its controls (entering text, selecting menu items, etc.), before submitting the form to an agent for processing (Forms).” Online forms, in general, are invaluable when needing to easily collect and organize data (Garofalo).</p>
            <p>HTML forms, in particular, are becoming... <a href="/writing/web-dev/forms.html">Read more!</a></p>
