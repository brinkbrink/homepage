            <h3>What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?</h3>

            <p>It appears to be in the name already but you may be wondering--what exactly is “Search Engine Optimization?” The most basic definition is that it is a methodology to improve your site’s visibility in search engine results. The value in SEO is its ability to attract more visitors to your website (“What is SEO / Search Engine Optimization?”). Today search engines are the most prominent way that people find websites, whether they represent businesses or artists or something in between, and are therefore invaluable to those owning or maintaining websites.  </p>
            <p>To better understand SEO, it's important to better understand how search engines operate. Search engines (think Google, Bing, Duckduckgo, etc) create massive indexes of websites using bots, called crawlers, that collect information from sites and use that information to include them in the aforementioned index. Algorithms then analyze the pages within the index, utilizing hundreds of factors, to figure out the ranking of pages in search results for a given query. The factors in question are typically determined based on estimates of how well a website or page can give the search engine user what they want to find (“What is SEO / Search Engine Optimization?”). These factors can be manipulated and this is where SEO can step in to help increase website visibility.</p>
            <p>The factors used in search engine algorithms to determine quality, and then ranking, of pages can be broken down into three sections according to Mozilla’s guide to SEO. Those three sections are: quality of traffic, quantity of traffic, and organic results. Quality of traffic refers to visitors that have genuine interest in your site. Quantity of traffic refers to the amount of visitors. Organic traffic is any unpaid traffic (not coming from ads).</p>
            <p>While quantity of traffic can be addressed via other methods like advertisements and social media optimization (SMO), both quality of traffic and organic traffic are chief concerns of SEO. Taking these factors into account it is not surprising that Google recommends that we “gear any optimization toward making the user experience better.” Don’t forget, those users include the search engine itself. So, another way of looking at SEO is seeing it as a methodology that helps search engines “understand and present content (“SEO”).”</p>
            <p>There are many technical ways to improve this understanding and presentation. They can be found in helpful starter guides curated by leaders in SEO like Google and Mozilla (they also have helpful tools for increasing SEO like Google Ad’s Keywood Planner or Google’s Search Console). These ways include: using a sitemap to alert search engines to new or changed pages, allowing bots access to JavaScript, CSS, and image files so they can see pages in the way of an average user, creating page titles using title tags and search result snippets that are unique, accurate, and concise, using the description meta tag and using unique descriptions for each page of your site, maintaining a simple navigation on your website, using the simplest URLs possible for pages, creating an image sitemap so your images are also searchable, using standard image formats and applying structured data to your site. There are other less technical, more content-oriented ways, to employ SEO as well like including expertise or authoritativeness on the content you’re presenting, making sure your content is comprehensive and, most importantly, knowing your visitors and giving them what they came to the website for as well as considering providing something they can’t find elsewhere (“SEO”). </p>
            <p>Through the use of SEO strategies the amount and quality of visitors will increase alongside the impact of your website. Search engine optimization is incredibly powerful and I look forward to sharing that power with you.</p>
