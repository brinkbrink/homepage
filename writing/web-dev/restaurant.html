            <h3>Restaurant Industry Research</h3>

            <p>In this summary I would like to explore methods that will be used on your restaurant website based on my research.</p>
            <p></p>First, the basics. While it may seem to be an obvious inclusion, it is an absolute necessity to have accurate information about your restaurant on its website. This information encompasses hours of operation, location, phone number, menu, prices, and email or contact form. Accurate information has become especially important with the rise of microsites (blurbs on Google, Yelp, etc) and their conflicting claims about these specifics (Behera).</p>
            <p>Another basic to cover is incorporating either a call-to-action or reservation widget. This should be one of the first things a customer notices when visiting the website. It allows potential customers an easy transition into becoming current customers (Peeling).</p>
            <p>The design of the website should be clean and inviting, just like your restaurant. This means simplicity; simple layout, clear navigation, and accessibility. It is also a good idea to match the feel of the website to the feel of its accompanying restaurant, something that represents what the customer will experience once they step into the physical space (Behera). One way to ensure this matching of virtual and physical experiences besides using similar color schemes and styles is to include a photo gallery of your food and the restaurant itself. This not only matches the virtual experience to the physical expectations but provides a way to entice your potential customers (Chris).</p>
            <p>Of course, with the advent of social media far behind us and now fully integrated into most of our lives, it also has a place in our restaurant websites. According to restaurant.org “three out of five Centennial’s buying decisions are influenced by social media.” Embedding your Instagram feed, for example, is a great way to engage but also another way to add imagery to your site. Social Media Optimization (SMO) also provides a straightforward way for people to advertise for you (for free!) by sharing your social media content (Loew).
            Another way to keep your restaurant in customers’ minds is an email newsletter. An email newsletter allows you to speak directly to your most loyal customers (Peeling). Including an email signup form in multiple relevant places around the website is a smart tactic that is easy to employ (Behera).</p>
            <p>Lastly, we need to consider smartphones. Smartphones are in almost everybody’s hands these days, especially while on the hunt for their next restaurant crafted meal. This makes Mobile-Friendly Design invaluable. It is also worthwhile to utilize Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) technologies in order to speed up loading times for your restaurant’s website (Behera).</p>
