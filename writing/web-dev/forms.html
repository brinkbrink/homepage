            <h3>Improving on HTML Forms</h3>

            <p>When engaging visitors on a website, a lot of engagement is one way--the website conveying information to the visitor--but sometimes a two way engagement is necessary. Sometimes visitors need to contact persons affiliated with the website and sometimes persons affiliated with the website want or need to collect information from the visitors. These contacts and collections can take the shape of contact forms, job applications, idea submission forms, guest books and much more (Garofalo).</p>
            <p>The most popular way to facilitate this kind of communication is through HTML Forms. According to w3.org, “an HTML form is a section of a document containing normal content, markup, special elements called controls (checkboxes, radio buttons, menus, etc.), and labels on those controls. Users generally "complete" a form by modifying its controls (entering text, selecting menu items, etc.), before submitting the form to an agent for processing (Forms).” Online forms, in general, are invaluable when needing to easily collect and organize data (Garofalo).</p>
            <p>HTML forms, in particular, are becoming more powerful. The HTML5 Forms utilized today began as Web Forms 2.0, created by the Web Hypertext Applications Technology Working Group (WHATWG). The latest iteration, HTML5 Forms, added 13 new input types to that initial Web Forms 2.0. Those newer input types are: search, tel, url, email, datetime, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color. These new inputs don’t just lend more power to HTML Forms but also provide another layer of semantic richness and useability to visitors (Satrom).</p>
            <p>There are many other ways to improve the user experience when creating HTML Forms. Ideas to contemplate when creating and improving forms include:</p>
            <div class="check-list">
            <ul>
                <li><input type="checkbox"> Know the audience and make form questions relevant to them </li>
                <li><input type="checkbox"> Give information with the form, including why the form should be filled and what is meant by certain queries</li>
                <li><input type="checkbox"> Make the form as simple as possible</li>
                <li><input type="checkbox"> Order the form logically</li>
                <li><input type="checkbox"> Show examples in form fields (one of HTML5 Forms’ inputs can do this)</li>
                <li><input type="checkbox"> Allow for full keyboard interactivity</li>
                <li><input type="checkbox"> Use clear error messages</li>
                <li><input type="checkbox"> Give feedback (highlight mandatory fields, color code as the form is being filled, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            </div> <!-- end check-list div -->
            <p>These are just some of the ways to make HTML Forms more powerful (Puri). There are many more. However, keep in mind: HTML Forms are especially useful when the visitors using them are considered.  </p>
